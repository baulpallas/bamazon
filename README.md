# bamazon

Welcome to bamazon! This is a command line application that utilizes node.js, inquirer and mysql. The application is meant to mimic Amazon as a fun way to get used to the aforementioned technologies. There a few different applications that are at play here:

- _bamazonCustomer.js:_ in the correct directory, the user inputs 'node bamazonCustomer.js' and is asked a series of prompts (using inquirer). The prompts guide the user through the process of purchasing an item.

- _bamazonManager:_ in the correct directory, the user inputs 'node bamazonManager.js'. The user can either: view products for sale, view low inventory, add to inventory or add new products to the products table within the bamazonDB SQL database.

- _bamazonSupervisor (ongoing):_ This application is not yet fully built as I ran out of time. I will complete at a later time.
